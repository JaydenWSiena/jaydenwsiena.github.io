## ðŸ’¡ Q) What is a hosting provider for web hosting? Give some other ways to host your websites.
The hosting provider is GitHub. You could also host your website on your own machine, or through sites such as Netlify.

## ðŸ’¡ Q) Does GitHub pages support custom domain names? for eg. if I want to host my website on [nchaudhari.com](http://nchaudhari.com) instead of [ninadpchaudhari.github.io](http://ninadpchaudhari.github.io) ? If yes, Specify the link to appropriate documentation. If no, suggest some workarounds.
Yes. If you go to the pages section in the Repository settings, you can give it a custom domain name (as long as you've bought that domain name).
